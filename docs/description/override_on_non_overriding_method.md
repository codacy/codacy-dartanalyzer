#### Description

The analyzer produces this diagnostic when a class member is annotated with
the `@override` annotation, but the member isnâ€™t declared in any of the
supertypes of the class.

#### Example

The following code produces this diagnostic because `m` isn't declared in
any of the supertypes of `C`:

```dart
class C {
  @override
  String [!m!]() => '';
}
```

#### Common fixes

If the member is intended to override a member with a different name, then
update the member to have the same name:

```dart
class C {
  @override
  String toString() => '';
}
```

If the member is intended to override a member that was removed from the
superclass, then consider removing the member from the subclass.

If the member can't be removed, then remove the annotation.
