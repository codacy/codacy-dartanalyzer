**AVOID** lines longer than 80 characters

Readability studies show that long lines of text are harder to read because your
eye has to travel farther when moving to the beginning of the next line. This is
why newspapers and magazines use multiple columns of text.

If you really find yourself wanting lines longer than 80 characters, our
experience is that your code is likely too verbose and could be a little more
compact. The main offender is usually `VeryLongCamelCaseClassNames`. Ask
yourself, “Does each word in that type name tell me something critical or
prevent a name collision?” If not, consider omitting it.

Note that `dart format` does 99% of this for you, but the last 1% is you. It 
does not split long string literals to fit in 80 columns, so you have to do 
that manually.

We make an exception for URIs and file paths. When those occur in comments or
strings (usually in imports and exports), they may remain on a single line even
if they go over the line limit. This makes it easier to search source files for
a given path.
